## üß† About 

This self-taught Marketing Analytics and BI curriculum is a structured roadmap that I created to guide myself in learning this field independently and for free. My motivation for developing this material came from my desire to deepen my knowledge in digital marketing, data-driven decision-making, and business intelligence, making the most of the available online resources.

The program covers everything from fundamentals to advanced topics, including marketing strategy, consumer behavior, analytics, data visualization, performance measurement, and predictive modeling. To achieve this, I selected high-quality courses and learning materials that are freely accessible.

If you also want to learn Marketing Analytics and BI on your own or expand your knowledge in the field, this roadmap can serve as a solid foundation for your journey.
